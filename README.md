# Landwind Landing Page

This repository hosts the Landwind landing page located in the `landwind-main/` directory. A GitHub Actions workflow publishes the static site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `work` branch.

## Deployment

1. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to use GitHub Actions in the repository settings.
2. Push changes to the `work` branch (or run the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow manually) to build Tailwind CSS and publish the site.
